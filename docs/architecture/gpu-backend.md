# GPU Backend Architecture

Status: working

Updated: 2026-08-25

## Purpose

Bloom should use the GPU for interactive compositing, display processing, and other parallel work
without making project semantics depend on a vendor, operating system, or UI toolkit. The CPU
reference evaluator remains the correctness oracle. GPU execution is an acceleration strategy over
the same immutable evaluation request.

The initial working direction is one Vulkan renderer on Linux and Windows and the same Vulkan code
through MoltenVK on macOS. This is not accepted until the cross-platform spike in this document
passes.

## Decision Summary

- Target Vulkan 1.2 as the provisional baseline API.
- Use native Vulkan drivers on Linux and Windows and bundle a pinned MoltenVK build on macOS.
- Use Vulkan-Hpp for typed C++ bindings and RAII handles. Wrap Vulkan Memory Allocator behind
  Bloom-owned resource types rather than exposing it through public render interfaces.
- Author Bloom GPU kernels as Vulkan GLSL and compile them to SPIR-V. Compile shipped kernels
  offline; compile generated OCIO shader programs off the UI thread and cache the resulting modules
  and pipelines.
- Keep a Bloom-owned backend interface between the evaluator and Vulkan. It represents Bloom
  operations and resources, not a second generic graphics API.
- Keep presentation separate from offscreen evaluation. Qt may create windows and surfaces, but Qt
  types do not enter `src/render` or `src/runtime`.
- Never wait for GPU work, compile a shader or pipeline, upload a full frame, or destroy a busy GPU
  resource on the UI thread.
- Expose one Bloom-owned immutable capability report. Device initialization establishes only a
  hardware/bootstrap baseline; `Unavailable`, `PreviewOnly`, and `ReferenceParity` are
  per-operation-and-precision outcomes, not a device-wide marketing tier.
- Qualify a closed, versioned operation vocabulary against the CPU fixtures before the scheduler may
  select it. The first `GpuOperationId` values are `SolidV1`,
  `TranslationOpacityBilinearV1`, `SourceOverV1`, `OcioDisplayV1`, and `PackedDisplayV1`.

The Vulkan specification describes explicit graphics and compute control, while MoltenVK implements
a Vulkan subset over public Metal APIs and converts SPIR-V to Metal Shading Language. MoltenVK also
documents known portability limits, so support is capability-driven rather than inferred from an API
version alone. [Vulkan specification](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html),

```

`src/render` owns logical GPU resources, command generation, synchronization, and backend errors.
`src/runtime` decides which validated implementation evaluates a node. `src/ui` owns any `QWindow`,
`QVulkanInstance`, or `QWidget` integration. The document model does not know whether a result came
from CPU or GPU execution.

The backend interface should expose operations such as device discovery, capability reports,
resource creation, asynchronous work submission, completion, cancellation state, and diagnostics.
It must not mirror every Vulkan object or flag. Backend-native handles remain internal except through
a narrow, non-owning presentation interop contract.

The public capability boundary is Qt- and Vulkan-free. Conceptually it contains:

- `GpuQualification`: `Unavailable`, `PreviewOnly`, or `ReferenceParity`, stored on each
  operation-and-precision capability;
- `GpuDeviceState`: `Initializing`, `Ready`, `Lost`, `Recovering`, `Unavailable`, or
  `ShuttingDown`, followed by terminal `Stopped`;
- backend/build/shader/compiler identities and the selected physical-device/driver identity;
- checked limits, memory-budget support, floating-point controls, portability-subset facts, and
  presentation capabilities; and
- one `GpuOperationCapability` per operation ID and precision, with required features, tested
  implementation revision, numeric contract, fixture-set digest, qualification outcome, and ordered
  structured diagnostics.

The report is immutable and generation-scoped. `Ready` means the device passed the bootstrap
requirements needed to probe and submit work; it grants no operation a qualification outcome.
A resource, pipeline, or frame created under one device generation cannot be published or looked up
under another. No `Vk*` type, raw handle, extension flag, or MoltenVK object appears in these Bloom
public values.

## Execution And Threading

One long-lived GPU service owns a logical device and its queue submission state. Command recording
may later use worker threads, but submission ordering and resource retirement remain centralized.
The UI submits a render intent and receives either a completed-frame notification or a structured
failure. It never polls a fence.

The GPU spike must add an asynchronous `TaskExecutor::Gpu` contract; it may not reuse the current
synchronous `TaskFunction`, which becomes terminal when its call returns. The GPU executor is a
bounded service event loop owned by the GPU thread. Admission creates a move-only scheduler-owned
`GpuTaskCompletion` token, queues one state-machine request, and leaves the task `Running`. Submission
callbacks advance that state machine without blocking. A fence/timeline completion, device-loss
event, or cancellation cleanup consumes the token exactly once and publishes the terminal result
through the ordinary task mailbox. Dropping an unconsumed token is an internal failure and
terminalizes the task; it never leaves a permanently running record.

The token carries `TaskId`, task generation, cancellation state, and a weak scheduler completion
sink, but no Qt or Vulkan handle. Only the GPU service may consume it. The service owns device and
queue submission; ordinary CPU or blocking-I/O workers prepare immutable inputs but never submit or
wait for GPU work. Separate caps bound admitted state machines, queued command bytes, live tokens,
and request-owned GPU memory before allocation. Queue exhaustion applies back-pressure at admission.
The spike is not accepted until this continuation path, exactly-once terminalization, and scheduler
shutdown behavior exist; a synchronous fence wait hidden inside the current task function is not a
valid interim implementation.

- Requests carry snapshot identity, time, output, resolution, quality, color intent, and a
  cancellation generation.
- A newer interactive request supersedes older preview work. Submitted GPU commands may complete,
  but their results can be discarded without becoming current UI state.
- Shader compilation, pipeline creation, media decode, CPU/GPU transfers, and cache eviction run on
  workers or the GPU service thread.
- Resource destruction is deferred until the last submission that references the resource has
  completed.
- Final renders use bounded queues and back-pressure rather than allocating one frame's resources
  per requested output.
- GPU timing, queue delay, compilation time, upload/download volume, cache hits, and memory pressure
  are observable in diagnostics.
- Staged shutdown closes GPU admission, requests cancellation on every live completion token, and
  lets the GPU event loop consume device completions or device-loss cleanup until every admitted
  token is terminal. It then destroys active device resources on the GPU thread and only afterward
  exits and joins. A qualified shutdown has a bounded device-loss fallback that terminalizes all
  remaining tokens before service destruction. The application never destroys the device from the
  UI thread after its owner has exited.

No subsystem may call `vkDeviceWaitIdle` or `vkQueueWaitIdle` as part of an interactive frame loop.
Those operations are limited to controlled shutdown or exceptional recovery paths, outside the UI
thread.

## Capability And Qualification Policy

Bloom probes the physical device, queue families, limits, per-format features, memory budget, and
extensions at startup. The result is stored as a runtime capability report, not project state.

The device bootstrap baseline should require:

- Vulkan 1.2, a compute-capable queue, storage buffers, sampled images, and transfer operations;
- timeline semaphore support from the Vulkan 1.2 feature set; and
- the queue, synchronization, allocation, and limit-query behavior needed to run bounded probes.

Format sampling/transfer/storage support, storage-image versus storage-buffer implementations,
required 2D extent or tiling, precision controls, and memory budgets are checked on each operation
capability. `VK_KHR_swapchain` and surface support belong only to presentation capabilities. Failure
of one such check makes that operation/precision/presentation entry unavailable; it does not erase
valid capabilities or make a successfully initialized headless device globally unavailable.

On a portability implementation, Bloom enables `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration`, creates the
instance with `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR`, and enables
`VK_KHR_portability_subset` when the selected device advertises it. Every required capability is
still checked directly. Optional extensions may improve throughput but cannot add authoring or
render semantics that have no portable implementation.

MoltenVK support is never inferred from a macOS version, Apple GPU family, advertised Vulkan
version, or successful device creation. The exact portability-subset restrictions and enabled
features are recorded in the report and exercised by the same operation fixtures as native Vulkan.

Capabilities are grouped by operation rather than a marketing tier. A node declares its CPU
implementation, GPU implementation, required formats/features, and parity tolerance. The scheduler
may form CPU and GPU regions, but it includes transfer cost when choosing a path. Repeated CPU/GPU
ping-pong is a planning failure to report and optimize, not an invisible default.

Large images must not be silently clamped. If an image exceeds a device limit or memory budget,
Bloom either uses a tested tiled implementation, evaluates on CPU, or reports an actionable error.

Qualification outcomes have precise meaning:

- `Unavailable` means no safe implementation is admitted. Bloom uses CPU or fails the operation.
- `PreviewOnly` means the operation passed safety and declared preview tests but not the reference
  precision/parity gate. Preview status names the degradation; final output cannot select it.
- `ReferenceParity` means the exact backend, operation, precision, shader and compiler revisions,
  device capability profile, and fixture-set digest passed the frozen CPU comparison gate. Only
  this outcome may become eligible for strict final work in a later accepted policy.

For a requested operation set and requested precision, the scheduler derives an aggregate result as
the least-qualified required operation. This is a request-planning result, not a mutable field on the
device report. A missing operation/precision entry is `Unavailable`; unsupported operations do not
inherit another operation's outcome, and an `RGBA16F` result never qualifies an `RGBA32F` request.
Capability reports are diagnostic inputs and cache identity, not project authoring state.

## Image Semantics And Correctness

The GPU backend does not choose Bloom's canonical color or alpha model. Evaluation requests provide
explicit color intent, and image descriptors carry channel type, dimensions, alpha semantics, and
color-space metadata independently of Vulkan formats.

`RGBA16F` is the initial candidate for interactive GPU intermediates because it is useful for HDR
compositing and bandwidth-sensitive previews. `RGBA32F`, packed display surfaces, deep data, and
other representations are capability- and operation-specific. Choosing a GPU format never reduces
the precision requested for strict final output without an explicit policy and visible diagnostic.

Every initial accelerated operation also has a CPU reference implementation. GPU parity is tested
with documented absolute, relative, and image-level tolerances appropriate to the operation; it is
not assumed to be bit-identical across vendors. Cache keys include the implementation revision,
shader revision, quality mode, relevant capabilities, and device/driver identity when those can
change results. The normative value, precision, color, alpha, and primitive-version contracts are
owned by [`evaluation-primitives.md`](evaluation-primitives.md).

The first reference-parity profile uses `RGBA32F`. Its numeric gates are:

- solid fill, clear, transparent borders, zero/one opacity endpoints, and alpha endpoints are
  bit-exact to the CPU fixture;
- Translation/Opacity Bilinear v1 and Source-Over v1 use per-finite-component absolute and relative
  error limits of `2e-6`, with the comparison accepting a component only when either limit passes;
- no successful finite CPU result may become NaN or infinity; negative and HDR RGB are preserved;
- subnormal and signed-zero cases follow the primitive fixture expectation. A device that flushes or
  rewrites a required case does not earn `ReferenceParity` for that operation;
- qualified packed display RGB differs from the CPU result by at most one 8-bit code value per
  channel, while alpha is exact; and
- any fixture outside these limits is a capability failure. A tolerance is not widened after seeing
  a device result without a reviewed primitive/qualification version change.

`RGBA16F` remains a distinct `PreviewOnly` profile until it has its own explicit precision and image
quality contract. Passing an `RGBA16F` preview gate says nothing about `RGBA32F` reference parity.

Until a later decision admits a qualified GPU operation profile for final output, deterministic
final export uses the CPU reference path. Enabling GPU final rendering is a deliberate policy in
addition to `ReferenceParity`, not an automatic consequence of having a GPU.

GPU process cache identity includes the process request identity, primitive and backend semantics,
backend/shader/SPIR-V/compiler revisions and options, texture/storage precision, operation
capability-profile digest, and device/driver identity whenever any of them may alter pixels. Display
cache identity additionally includes the qualified OCIO display processor identity from
[`color-management.md`](color-management.md). Request generation, cancellation, queue depth, and
budget do not affect pixel identity. Resource-generation identity is separate and prevents a cache
object from surviving device recreation even when its pixels would be equivalent.

## Shaders And OpenColorIO

Bloom-authored kernels use one reviewed Vulkan GLSL source path. Shipped shaders are compiled to
SPIR-V at build time, validated, reflected into explicit bindings, and packaged with a source and
compiler version. Runtime specialization should prefer constants and pipeline variants over
unbounded source generation.

OpenColorIO currently exposes `GPU_LANGUAGE_GLSL_VK_4_6` as a GPU shader target. Bloom uses an OCIO
`GPUProcessor` and `GpuShaderDesc` to obtain shader text, uniforms, and LUT textures. Because those
products are derived from project-selected configuration and external resources, Bloom treats the
generated shader and LUT payloads as bounded untrusted-derived input rather than trusted code.
OCIO config, processor cache ID, shader text and resource digests, compiler revision, and
device-relevant pipeline state participate in the cache key.
[OpenColorIO GPU language API](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO/blob/main/include/OpenColorIO/OpenColorTypes.h),
[OpenColorIO shader API](https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shaders.html)

The durable config revision, explicit context, source/output Color Interop IDs, display/view, looks,
and missing-config policy come from [`color-management.md`](color-management.md). The GPU adapter
does not read an ambient config or create a second display identity. CPU and GPU OCIO fixtures use
the same qualified processor intent; processor or resource mismatch is a capability failure, not a
reason to substitute the temporary reference mapper.

Before compilation or upload, the adapter enforces checked limits on shader bytes, tokens, entry
points, uniforms, texture count, LUT dimensions, aggregate LUT bytes, and compile time; validates LUT
shape and finite samples; and rejects unsupported OCIO resource forms. Shader compilation runs off
the UI and GPU service threads in a killable, resource-limited helper process. Bloom accepts its
output only after SPIR-V structural validation and reflection exactly match the declared entry point,
bindings, descriptor types, dimensions, and limits. Pipeline creation remains on the GPU service
thread and is covered by device-loss containment. A timeout, helper crash, validation mismatch,
driver failure, or budget breach produces an operation-scoped diagnostic, publishes no partial
pipeline or LUT, and cannot poison an existing qualified cache entry.

Glslang is the provisional GLSL-to-SPIR-V compiler because it is Khronos's reference front end and
can be used as a command-line tool or library. Its exact build and transitive licenses must be pinned
and audited before distribution. [Glslang project](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)

Arbitrary project-provided shader source is outside the initial scope. If scripting or shader nodes
are added later, validation, resource limits, and process isolation require a separate security
decision.

## ASWF Media Interop

OpenColorIO integrates by generating shader code and LUT data; it does not own Bloom's Vulkan
device. OpenImageIO and OpenEXR initially decode and encode through CPU memory followed by
asynchronous staging transfers. OpenEXRCore's thread-safe, non-blocking low-level API and support for
custom unpacking may later reduce copies, but direct GPU unpacking is a measured optimization rather
than an architectural prerequisite. [OpenEXR API](https://openexr.com/en/latest/API.html)

External GPU resource sharing is added only for a concrete integration and must specify ownership,
device identity, image layout/state, synchronization, lifetime, and fallback behavior. A raw native
handle alone is not an interop contract.

## Qt Presentation

Offscreen evaluation does not depend on Qt or a swapchain. A replaceable UI-side presentation
adapter consumes completed frame handles and presents them in a viewer.

The primary spike uses a custom Vulkan-capable `QWindow` embedded in the panel shell. Public Qt APIs
can associate a `QVulkanInstance` with a window, obtain a cross-platform `VkSurfaceKHR`, and query
presentation support without Bloom writing Win32, X11/Wayland, or Cocoa surface code. An advanced
renderer may manage its own device and swapchain instead of using `QVulkanWindow`.
[QVulkanInstance](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qvulkaninstance.html),
[Qt Vulkan integration](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtgui-overview.html#vulkan-integration)

The target is a same-device GPU copy or sample into each viewer swapchain. CPU readback remains a
functional fallback and test path, not the normal interactive path. Multiple viewer panels share the
render device where surface support permits and own independent swapchain state.

`QRhiWidget` is useful for a comparison spike because it embeds accelerated rendering naturally in
Qt Widgets and supports Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D. It is not the core GPU backend. Accessing the
underlying QRhi requires `Qt::GuiPrivate`; Qt labels the QRhi family semi-public and provides no
source or binary compatibility guarantee across Qt minor versions. QRhi resources also cannot be
shared between QRhi instances. If Bloom later uses QRhi in a presentation adapter, that adapter must
be isolated, tested against an exactly pinned Qt minor version, and replaceable without changing
render semantics. [QRhi compatibility and threading](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qrhi.html),
[QRhiWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qrhiwidget.html)

## Device Lifecycle, Failure, And Fallback

The device service has one explicit lifecycle:

```text
Initializing -----------------------------> Ready
      |                                       |
      +-----------------> Unavailable         v
                                         Lost -> Recovering -> Ready
                                           |         |
                                           +---------+-----> Unavailable

Initializing/Ready/Lost/Recovering/Unavailable -> ShuttingDown -> Stopped
```

Initialization failure publishes its diagnostic and enters `Unavailable`; CPU execution remains
available. Shutdown may begin from every non-terminal state, closes admission before draining, and
wins over initialization or recovery. Once `ShuttingDown`, the service cannot return to `Ready` or
start another recovery. `Stopped` owns no live device, queue, pipeline, resource, or completion that
could later be published.

Device-loss injection points cover device creation, allocation, shader/pipeline creation, submit,
completion/fence observation, readback, and presentation. On the first loss signal the service:

1. atomically changes the generation state to `Lost` and stops new GPU admission;
2. completes outstanding GPU task results with a `DeviceLost` failure diagnostic, using cancellation
   only for work whose cancellation was independently requested;
3. invalidates all resources, pipeline/cache entries, and prepared frames from that generation;
4. exposes a visible CPU-preview fallback without publishing a stale GPU result as current;
5. attempts at most one controlled asynchronous device recreation during the process lifetime; and
6. resumes with a new generation and freshly measured capability report, or remains `Unavailable`.

Final output continues on CPU only when its immutable request and policy allow the CPU equivalent;
otherwise it fails. It never resumes partway through an output with mixed hidden semantics.

- No compatible GPU: start normally with the CPU renderer and show one persistent, actionable
  performance diagnostic.
- Unsupported node or format: schedule a CPU region when parity and transfer rules allow it; never
  substitute a different visual operation.
- Out of device memory: evict rebuildable GPU caches, retry within a bounded policy, then fall back
  or fail the request explicitly.
- Device loss: follow the bounded state machine above; repeated loss does not enter an unbounded
  recreate loop.
- Shader or pipeline failure: retain the compiler and driver diagnostic, identify the affected node,
  and use its CPU implementation when available.
- Preview fallback or reduced precision: expose it in viewer status. Strict final output does not
  degrade silently.

## Alternatives Evaluated

| Option | Strengths | Why it is not the working choice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Vulkan + MoltenVK | One explicit compute/render model, SPIR-V toolchain, strong diagnostics, direct control of queues, memory, and synchronization | High implementation cost; macOS is a portability subset and must pass real parity, performance, and presentation tests |
| Qt QRhi / QRhiWidget | Natural Qt Widgets integration; runtime Vulkan, Metal, D3D11/12, and OpenGL backends | Core QRhi requires `Qt::GuiPrivate` and has no cross-minor source or binary compatibility guarantee; its resource/threading model would couple the headless renderer to Qt |
| Dawn / WebGPU | Permissive native implementation over D3D12, Metal, and Vulkan; standardized capability and validation model | WGSL and WebGPU limits add another shader contract; native shared-resource facilities are implementation extensions and are not uniformly implemented, making pro-app interop and zero-copy presentation a risk today |
| Diligent Engine | Consistent C/C++ API, HLSL-oriented shader path, explicit compute and modern API backends | The open distribution's native Metal backend is commercially licensed; its free macOS route still uses a Vulkan portability layer, so it adds an abstraction without removing the main Apple risk |
| Native D3D12 + Metal + Vulkan | Maximum native control, tooling, and interop on each OS | Three production backends and shader paths multiply implementation and parity work before Bloom proves its first compositor |

Dawn is BSD-3-Clause licensed. Diligent Engine is Apache-2.0 overall, but its official support table
marks the native Metal backend as commercially licensed and notes independent third-party licenses.
These facts do not replace a distribution-time dependency audit.

## Cross-Platform Spike Gate

This direction becomes accepted only after the same bounded prototype passes on Linux, Windows, and
Apple Silicon macOS:

1. Run the exact closed operation vocabulary offscreen with `RGBA32F` and apply the numeric gates in
   this document. Fixtures include an empty stack; one and two solids with reorder; integer and
   fractional translation; opacity and all alpha endpoints; negative/HDR, signed-zero, and subnormal
   values; odd, proxy, 4K, and 8K extents; and matrix, 1D-LUT, and 3D-LUT OCIO display processors.
2. Run the same SPIR-V assets and backend code on native Linux/Windows Vulkan and Apple Silicon
   MoltenVK. Record the immutable capability report, exact fixture digest, comparison summary, and
   every failure. No platform-specific tolerance adjustment is allowed.
3. Present qualified output in the Qt Widgets Viewer, exercise resize, panel replacement,
   detach/reattach, rapid request supersession, cancellation barriers, cache pressure, and resource
   generation invalidation. The normal path performs no full-frame CPU readback.
4. Trace cold OCIO shader compile, pipeline creation, frame evaluation, queue/fence delay, and image
   upload while UI thread sentinels run. Predeclare latency and memory budgets for the test profile;
   report measurements rather than substituting subjective visual review.
5. Run Vulkan validation cleanly; capture GPU timings and a platform-native frame trace; serialize
   and reject incompatible pipeline caches. Inject allocation, shader, pipeline, submit, completion,
   readback, presentation, and device-loss failures and verify the lifecycle contract.
6. Stress bounded queue admission, supersession, staged shutdown, repeated loss, and CPU fallback.
   The Viewer stays responsive, last-good frames remain marked stale, and no cancelled or
   old-generation frame becomes current.
7. Qualify and lock the Vulkan loader/headers, Vulkan-Hpp, VMA, shader compiler, MoltenVK, and every
   bundled transitive component through [`dependency-intake.md`](dependency-intake.md), including
   offline rebuild, SBOM, shipped-file verification, and notices.

Before production acceptance, expand parity CI or lab coverage beyond one GPU per operating system
to include at least AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Apple GPU families that Bloom claims to support. Results
are machine-readable capability evidence; screenshots or “looks correct” approval do not replace
the numeric fixtures.

If the prototype fails because of MoltenVK correctness, sustained performance, or presentation
interop, do not hide the gap behind reduced quality. Time-box an A/B spike of Dawn's native Metal
backend and a small native Metal backend behind the same Bloom interface, then replace or narrow this
working decision with evidence. If only the Qt embedding path fails, retain the offscreen Vulkan
result and compare the custom `QWindow` and isolated QRhiWidget presentation adapters.

## Dependency Licenses To Track

- Vulkan-Hpp and MoltenVK: Apache-2.0.
- Vulkan Memory Allocator: MIT.
- Glslang: multiple permissive components, led by BSD-3-Clause for glslang proper; audit the exact
  compiled target and optional dependencies.
- Qt: community packages dynamically link the pinned LGPLv3 Qt distribution under accepted
  [ADR 0014](../decisions/0014-apache-license-and-qt-distribution.md). Depending on a private Qt
  target does not provide an ABI promise and increases upgrade/build coupling.
