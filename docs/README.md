This directory is Bloom's current source of truth. Historical notes outside this repository may
provide research or rationale, but they are not binding until adopted here.

## Reading Order

1. [`product/foundation.md`](product/foundation.md) — product identity, current decisions, v0 proof,
   and non-goals.
2. [`product/quality-bar.md`](product/quality-bar.md) — professional artist experience, reliability,
   responsiveness, and VFX expectations; [`product/node-catalogue.md`](product/node-catalogue.md) —
   planned artist-facing node families and delivery levels.
3. [`standards/strategy.md`](standards/strategy.md) — standards-first pipeline and interoperability
   policy.
4. [`ux/compositing-workspace.md`](ux/compositing-workspace.md) — the UI sketch as an interaction
   contract; [`ux/visual-language.md`](ux/visual-language.md) — iconography and typography.
5. [`architecture/overview.md`](architecture/overview.md) — boundaries, state ownership, and
   dependency direction.
6. [`architecture/module-system.md`](architecture/module-system.md),
   [`architecture/layer-graph-model.md`](architecture/layer-graph-model.md),
   [`architecture/animation-and-time.md`](architecture/animation-and-time.md),
   [`architecture/evaluation-primitives.md`](architecture/evaluation-primitives.md),
   [`architecture/task-system.md`](architecture/task-system.md),
   [`architecture/workspace-layout.md`](architecture/workspace-layout.md),
   [`architecture/project-format.md`](architecture/project-format.md),
   [`architecture/scripting-and-addons.md`](architecture/scripting-and-addons.md),
   [`architecture/gpu-backend.md`](architecture/gpu-backend.md), and
   [`architecture/platform-support.md`](architecture/platform-support.md) — execution and platform
   contracts and extension boundaries.
7. [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) — proof-oriented implementation sequence.
8. [`decisions/`](decisions/) — accepted architecture decision records.

## Status Vocabulary

- `accepted`: a binding current decision.
- `working`: the current direction, expected to be tested and refined.
- `proposed`: an option under discussion.
- `superseded`: retained for history but no longer current.

Documents should separate accepted decisions from working assumptions and open questions. Avoid
presenting deferred product scope as an implementation commitment.

## Documentation Rules

- Update the owning document rather than duplicating a decision.
- Record architecture changes as decision records when they affect multiple subsystems.
- Keep implementation-specific detail close to the code it governs.
- Never include machine-specific paths, credentials, tokens, or private environment details.
