# Third-Party Notices

Bloom itself is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see `LICENSE`). This file is the
repository-level inventory of third-party content vendored into this repository -- content whose
bytes are checked in here and shipped inside the Bloom binary or its resources.

Third-party libraries Bloom builds from pinned upstream source archives rather than vendoring are
inventoried separately in `dependencies/dependencies.lock.json`, with their license texts,
provenance, review, and security records under `dependencies/licenses/`.

## Vendored interface assets

| Component | Version | License | Files | Records |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phosphor Icons (core assets) | v2.0.8 | MIT | `src/ui/kit/third_party/phosphor-icons/` | `LICENSE`, `provenance.md` |

Each component directory retains its upstream license text unmodified and a `provenance.md` that
records the exact upstream release, the source archive URL, the SHA-256 of the archive the assets
were taken from, and a SHA-256 for every vendored file.
